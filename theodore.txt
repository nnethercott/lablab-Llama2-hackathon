1. I have been thinking about how I could possibly tell you how much you mean to me. I remember when I first started to fall in love with you like it was last night. Lying naked beside you in that tiny apartment, it suddenly hit me that I was part of this whole larger thing, just like our parents, and our parents’ parents. Before that I was just living my life like I knew everything, and suddenly this bright light hit me and woke me up. Still to this day, every day, you make me feel like the person I was when you first turned on the lights and woke me up and we started this adventure together. 

2. I miss you so much it hurts my whole body! The world is being unfair to us! The world is on my shit list. As is this couple that is making out across from me in this restaurant. I think I'm going to have to go on a mission of revenge. I must beat up the world's face with my bare knuckles making it a bloody, pulpy mess.  And I’ll stomp on this couple’s teeth for reminding me of your sweet, little, cute, crooked tooth that I love.  

3. Will you always come home to me and tell me about your day? Will you tell me about the boring guy who talked too much at work? And the stain you got on your shirt at lunch.  Tell me about a funny thought you had as you were waking up, but had forgotten about. Tell me how crazy everyone is. We can laugh about it. Even if you get home late and I’m asleep already, just whisper in my ear one little thought you had today. Because I love the way you look at the world, and I’m so happy I get to be next to you and look out at the world through your eyes.
